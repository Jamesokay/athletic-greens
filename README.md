# WordPress + Tailwind CSS Replication of the AG1 Website

Live site available [here](https://darkred-dog-564022.hostingersite.com/)

## About

My goal here was to rapidly learn WordPress. To do so, I have built a custom theme that reproduces the display of the AG1 e-commerce site. Thus far, I have built abbreviated versions of the Home Page and What Is AG1 Page. I have implemented Advanced Custom Fields for the Home Page, allowing users to dynamically update the content. Layout is responsive across all screen sizes.

## In Progress

- Finish the Build A Bundle payment flow and implement WooCommerce
- Continued optimisation
